Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

  The application that I developeed was a weight tracking app, not necissarily a weight loss app but just tracking. The app requirements was to have a login, a way to update your
goal and current weight, a way to track your daily weight, and a sms notification. The user needs that were addressed in this app was a way for users to help track if they are
gaining or losing weight depending on their goals.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

  There were 4 screens that were necessary to support these needs, the screens were a login screen, a sms screen, a main screen, and a stored screen. The features on these screens
differed first the log in screen would allow the user to create or log into an account, the sms screen was for verifying if the user would receive sms notifications, the main
screen has a way to enter your goal and current weight, and the stored screen stores and tracks the users daily weight. The UI design that I went with keeps the screens simple and
user friendly, I had gone back and forth between some designs after the second project.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

  The approach for coding the application was a checklist, I first focused on the requirements for the project in order and then added something of my own after meeting the requirements.
The strategies I used was to break up the coding into sections forcing myself to focus on one part at a time and then going back later to fix any issues after adding a new section.
I think that this is a very efficient way to develope anything, making a checklist and going down the list fixing any issues along the way and I have used this and will continue
using this stratagy in the future. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

  Main testing for the project was running the application and trying it when I would add something to the code all whill keeping an eye on any error in the lines. This is not the most
efficient way to test code, after all it is better to create in line debugging while developing so you know where an error is if you should encounter one but I found myself rushing a 
little. This process is, if not, the most important part of developing any code as it will allow you to fix any mistakes and make sure you are following a proper quality approach
to development.

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

  The full app design and development process was very difficult to me as it is something newer to me and I do not use java very often. There were a lot of challenges that I have faced in 
this class, it has probably been my most difficult class so far. The first challenge that I ran into was the creation of the UI, I did not know how I was going to go about creating the
interface for a platform I have never used before. I had created something that I thought was going to be easy to make in the Android Studio app but it turned out that I had
overcomplicated the UI. When I went to develop this UI into the code I had to over simplify the screens as my knoledge and experience is not enough to reach what I set out to do. Another
challenge was the code itself, I was already running late on the project and I could not figgure out the connection of screens into one UI, I had tried multiple things to do this but I
ran out of time to do so this is probably my biggest regret with the app.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

  I think, sadly, the best component in my mobile app is the BMI calculator. This upsets me becuase it was not a part of the requirements of the project and something that I had added after
I met them. Another component that I was proud of was the database shell, this probably does not show my skill or knoledge as well but it was something that I had struggled with and was very
proud to overcome and complete.
